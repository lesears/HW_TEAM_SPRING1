Here's what I want you to do:

Load a CSV file into a spark dataframe. You can use any data that you'd like, however, if you are using my Docker container, I already have data loaded within the /data directory (/data/tmdb_5000_movies.csv and /data/nyc_taxi_data.csv)

Display (show) the top 15 records for that spark dataframe that you just loaded.

Display the total number of records in the spark dataframe.

Filter the spark dataframe (I'll let you choose what column(s) you want to filter on).

Perform a groupby (aggregation) that sums one of your numeric variables across a categorical variable. For example, sum the trip_distance by vehicle_id.
